A W.I.P potential for the dissociation process of an acetone radical cation

                      CH3COCH3+· --> CH3CO+ + CH3·,

as detailed in J. Phys. Chem. A 2008, 112, 13121–13127. This potential was
trained under the UMP2/6-31G* level, and will lead to a active/spectator methyl
dissociation ratio of 1.60 (with a initial total mode energy of 10 kcal/mol
above the ZPE of the TS structure).
